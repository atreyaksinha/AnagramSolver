# AnagramSolver

This implements a class that uses a dictionary to find all combinations of words that have the same letters as a given phrase.

An anagram is a word or phrase made by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase. For example, the words “midterm” and “trimmed” are anagrams. If you ignore spaces and capitalization and allow multiple words, a multi-word phrase can be an anagram of some other word or phrase. For example, the phrases “Clint Eastwood” and “old west action” are anagrams.

This program uses recursive backtracking to find combinations of words that have the same letters as the given string. It prints all combinations of words from the dictionary that are anagrams of text and that include at most max words.
